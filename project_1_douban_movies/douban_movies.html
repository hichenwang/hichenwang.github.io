<h1>Is there any movie well-known in North America but barely heard of in China?</h1>
<!-- #<p class="teaser">Car manufacturers programmed their diesel engines to deactivate nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emission controls when the outside temperature drops. Do these &quot;thermal window defeat devices&quot; cause a measurable effect?</p> -->

<p class="by">by CHEN WANG</a> &nbsp;|&nbsp; July 23, 2017</p>

<p>I found 5,459 movies that have ratings on both IMDb and Douban, after analyzing 40,810 movies on <a href="https://movie.douban.com/" target="_blank">Douban</a> (豆瓣), a popular Chinese social networking service website allowing registered users to record information and create content related to film, books, music, recent events and activities in Chinese cities. 
The difference are the movies: (1) has an IMDb page but doesn't have enough voters on IMDb or/and Douban to generate a rating; (2) doesn't have a IMDb page.
Among these 5,450 movies, 2,345 movies have more than 10,000 ratings on both IMDb and Douban. 
The best movie is the BBC documentary <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5491994" target="_blank">"Planet Earth Season 2"</a>, which has a rating of 9.6 on IMDb and 9.9 on Douban, and the worst is the Korean fantasy movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372873/" target="_blank">"Dragon Wars: D-War"</a>, 3.6 on IMDb and 4.0 on Douban.</p>

<p>However, is there any movie well-known in North America but barely heard of in China?</p>

<p>The answer is, yes, but not many.</p>

<div class="content"><img src="intro.png" /></div>

<p>It is not surprising that all the 30 movies only popular on Douban can be classified into only 5 categories. </p>

<!-- <p>The colder it gets the more NO2 is in the air? It's not that simple! This gets even clearer when we change the time we're looking at.</p> -->

<h2>Almost no correlation during morning rush hour</h2>

<p>In the morning hours there is no distinct pattern at all. In most cities the measurements seem to be arranged arbitraryly on the scatter plots below:</p>

<p>This raises the question if the so called thermal window defeat devices had any measurable effect at all.</p>

<p>The NO2 air pollution data was provided by the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) and temperature data came from the German Meteorological Office (Deutscher Wetterdienst). Please find all the data and the Python script that analysed it in this project's <a href="https://github.com/marcelpauly/data-studio-projects/tree/master/code/NOx_air_pollution" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
