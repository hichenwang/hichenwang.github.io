<!-- #<p class="teaser">Car manufacturers programmed their diesel engines to deactivate nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emission controls when the outside temperature drops. Do these &quot;thermal window defeat devices&quot; cause a measurable effect?</p> -->

<!-- <p>So there seems to be a correlation: With higher temperatures there is less NO2 in the air and vice versa.</p> -->

<!-- <h2>Only infrequent connection during afternoon rush hour</h2> -->

<!-- <p> But when we look to the measurements from other cities we see far weaker correlations. In some cases there seems to be a contrary effect:</p> -->

<!-- <p>The colder it gets the more NO2 is in the air? It's not that simple! This gets even clearer when we change the time we're looking at.</p> -->

<!-- 
<h2>Almost no correlation during morning rush hour</h2>

<p>In the morning hours there is no distinct pattern at all. In most cities the measurements seem to be arranged arbitraryly on the scatter plots below:</p>

<p>This raises the question if the so called thermal window defeat devices had any measurable effect at all.</p>

<p>The NO2 air pollution data was provided by the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) and temperature data came from the German Meteorological Office (Deutscher Wetterdienst). Please find all the data and the Python script that analysed it in this project's <a href="https://github.com/marcelpauly/data-studio-projects/tree/master/code/NOx_air_pollution" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>.
