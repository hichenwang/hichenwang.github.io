    <p class="story">Topping the list was Jeff Lyash, CEO of Ontario Power Generation, with a combined salary and taxable benefits clocking in at $1,165,701.85, one of only two people on it earning more than a million dollars.</p>

    <p class="asterisk" align="left">Data source: <a href="https://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/publications/salarydisclosure/pssd/" target="_blank">Ontario Ministry of Finance.</a>
    <p class="asterisk" align="left"><a href="http://www.sunshinelist.ca/" target="_blank">Sunshinlist.com</a> was also used to verify data, especially duplicates and mismatches.</p>

    <p class="asterisk" align="left">1. OpenRefine was used to clean and cluster duplicates and unaligned names of the names of same companies, people, and job titles. Duplicates and mismatches still potentially exist in the cleaned dataset.</p>
    <p class="asterisk" align="left">2. ScaleLog was used to smooth out the difference among people's salary to make it possible to apply color coding.</p>
    <p class="asterisk" align="left">3. Indivisual's salary has been rounded (int(round(salary_2016/5000)*5000)) and grouped for the sake of a better organized distribution chart.</p>
    <p class="asterisk" align="left">4. The analysis of the changes of salaries over years didn't include the influence of inflation. Indiviual was possibly the employee of differenet institutes in different years or even in the same year.</p>
