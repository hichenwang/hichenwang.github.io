    <h1>In the country of no mandatory paid maternity leave, there are companies caring more.</h1>

    <p class="story">When I was pitching this story and mentioning there’s no maternity leave in the United States, my classmate, from a country other than America, burst out a “What?!”. And unfortunately, my clarification that “no PAID maternity leave, but you can get minimum 12 unpaid weeks” was followed by a big eye-rolling. Yes, you felt the disappointment from a foreigner, not to say the parents in this country.</p>
    <p class="story">But my clarification was still not accurate – actually, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-family-and-medical-leave-laws.aspx" target="_blank">three states, California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, currently offer paid family and medical leave,</a> and New York will join them soon on Jan. 1, 2018 and Washington and The District of Columbia in 2020.</p>
    <p class="story">If you've been paying attention to the political news in the past couple of years, mandating paid family leave has been one of the top talking over years. People clearly know the benefits of paid maternity leave, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ritarubin/2016/04/06/united-states-lags-behind-all-other-developed-countries-when-it-comes-to-paid-maternity-leave/#3e6936468f15" target="_blank">which are backed up by studies of authority: </a> a bigger likelihood of breastfeeding, fewer symptoms of depression, and better recovery and bonding with babies for new mothers.</p>

    <p class="story">However, these long-term and hard-to-be-quantified benefits are dwarfed in front of <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/07/15/422957640/lots-of-other-countries-mandate-paid-leave-why-not-the-us" target="_blank">American’s love of individualism and more importantly, the opposing power from the business side</a>. Before the paid family leave program approved in this June, the Washington State already passed the Washington Family and Medical Leave Insurance Act as early as in 2007, <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/washington-legislature-passes-paid-family-leave-measure/" target="_blank">which was never implemented due to the lack of a funding plan.</a></p>

And these graphs are still valid for today.</p>

    <p class="story">According to a <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2017/03/23/americans-widely-support-paid-family-and-medical-leave-but-differ-over-specific-policies/" target="_blank">survey</a> by the Pew Research Center, a non-partisan American think tank, 82% of the interviewees say mothers should receive paid leave following birth or adoption of their child and 61% say this benefit should be paid by employers. But very few workers enjoy the access to paid leave, and access varies considerably by industry. The result of <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2017/benefits_leave.htm" target="_blank">the National Compensation Survey</a>, conducted annually by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, shows that in 2016 38% of the finance and insurance employees had access to paid family leave, versus a  merely 5% of those in the construction industry.</p>
