    <h1>In the country with no mandatory paid maternity leave, there are companies caring more.</h1>

    <p class="story">When I was pitching this story and mentioning there’s no maternity leave in the United States, my classmate, from a country other than America, burst out a “What?!”. And unfortunately, my clarification that “no PAID maternity leave, but you can get minimum 12 unpaid weeks” was followed by a big eye-rolling. Yes, you felt the disappointment from a foreigner, not to say the parents in this country.</p>
     <p class="story">But my clarification was still not accurate – actually, <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-family-and-medical-leave-laws.aspx" target="_blank">three states, California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, currently offer paid family and medical leave,</a> and New York will join them soon on Jan. 1, 2018. So next year, the number of the states offering paid family leave will rocket by 33.33%.</p>
     <p class="story">I tried several graph ideas to show America’s slightly embarrassing stance in this topic. Like a scatterplot in which every other OECD country fly in the sky while America staying at the origin point waiting for its moment, fists clenched.</p>
